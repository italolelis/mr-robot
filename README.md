# Mr Robot

Testing application for the AWS IoT Button. 
The idea of this project it's just to play around with the new AWS Button. The functionalities are pretty simple.

### Single Click

A single click just outputs a random message of the day on your slack channel for you.

### Double Click

Wanna know how is the weather for Berlin at the moment? Just double click it and look at your slack channel.

### Long Click

Will show you random HelloFresh recipe straight to your slack channel which you can cook.

## Setup the button on AWS IoT and connect it to WiFi

By following [Amazon’s getting started guide](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/button/), you can setup the button on the IoT platform in a few minutes. 
You will need your button’s DSN code — located on the back, and a secret activation code, that was given to 
you along with the button.
